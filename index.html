        <ul>
        <li> Hi, my name is Campbell! I’m an aspiring web designer who from a young age has always been fascinated with computers and the web. I've lived in lots of different countries, but mainly in China, for a total of nearly 7 years now! I have worked in lots of different jobs, but mainly in languages, which I feel has given me a reasona ble aptitude for learning new languages(such as computer languages).</li> 

       <li>I’ve been a Teacher and Interpreter/Translator for most of my professional career, however,  I am looking to change things up. In the past, I wanted to get into Tech but my path went a different way, now I am ready to change that path and I'm definitely an avid learner always craving a new challenge.</li>
       
       <li>I’m excited to bring my life experience to this new field and look forward to applying myself whilst learning to code and design websites, apps and programs!</li>
